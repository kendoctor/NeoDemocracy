Here, we will REDISCOVER this idea which should be UPDATED for meeting the needs in the new era through digging out its NATURE.

> Why we need to emphasize we are going to rediscover? Because the new definition has lots of differences against the traditional.

## Traditional Definitions Of Capitalism

The traditional definitions : 

1. Capitalism is an ECONOMIC and POLITICAL system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by PRIVATE owners for PROFIT, rather than by the state. -- Taken from Google.

2. Capitalism is an ECONOMIC system in which investment in and ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange of wealth is made and maintained chiefly by private INDIVIDUALs or corporations, especially as contrasted to cooperatively or STATE-OWNED means of wealth. -- Taken from Dictionary.com

3. Capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. -- Taken from wikipedia.org

Also, there are lots of other definitions. But, almost of them do not tell you its NATURE.

## Generalized Definition Of Capitalism

In order to distinguish the traditional definitions, the new one is called Generalized Capitalism.

It is a WAY of THINKING by which individuals or organizations in society accumulate their ADVANTAGEs (these advantages are capital) to gain more advantages through FREE COMPETITION in social activities.

> The core characteristics are
1. Thinking and acting from the individual perspective and on behalf of individuals in society
2. Aggregate capital through free competition
3. Diversity

The cause that motivate people to take social activities based on this concept is Natural law - survival of the fittest
Therefore, capitalism have always existed since the birth of society. 

## The difference between traditional and generalized definitions

1. Like Einstein's general theory of relativity and special theory of relativity, the generalized definition of capitalism is more abstract, while the traditional definition is more specific.
2. Generalized capital is not only about money and material wealth, but also about spiritual wealth or knowledge or acknowledgement or abilities. Political power belongs to the latter.
3. Generalized capitalism has existed since the birth of society. It is the final product of free competition following the nature law and it is an inevitable way of thinking. It is not someone's invention. People just describe it according to their own knowledge. No matter how you define it, its core characteristics are certain.
Capitalism does not only involve economic and political fields, but all social activities, such as culture and military.
